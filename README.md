Analisys eCommerce data

In that project i prepared, clear data and tried to answer this qustions:

How many users do we have who made a purchase only once? 

How many orders per month, on average, are not delivered for various reasons (display details by reasons)? 

For each product, determine on which day of the week the product is most often bought? 

How many purchases does each user make on average per week (by months)? Do not forget that there may not be an integer number of weeks within a month. For example, November 2021 has 4.28 weeks. And within the metrics, this must be taken into account?
